I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue advised by [Prof. Sotiris Nousias](https://sotirisnousias.com/). I do computer vision things.

I was a Master's student in ECE (Machine Learning & Data Science) at UC San Diego, and was co-advised by [Prof. Nick Antipa](https://www.nickantipa.com/) and Dr. Sophia Merrifield. My research was on the rigid 6DoF pose estimation of buried objects in the seabed.

During my undergrad, I majored in Probability and Statistics at UC San Diego, and did oceanographic research with X-Band and HF radar for [CORDC](https://cordc.ucsd.edu/).
