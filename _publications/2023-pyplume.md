PyPlume is a Python toolbox and pipeline for unifying the process of loading two-dimensional oceanic current vector fields from models and observations, simulating trajectory models, and analyzing and visualizing particle trajectories. Jupyter notebooks and methods are provided to make simulations easy to configure and manage while also providing an interface for rapid assessment of simulated trajectories. Features include live data downloads and the setup of simulations through configuration files. The software provides a modular selection of boundary conditions, gap-filling schemes, and advection kernels. Model outputs can be visualized by the suite of plotting tools provided by PyPlume, and be exported for offline analysis with other tools. Example applications of PyPlume include near real-time and forecast analysis of surface pollutants in coastal waters.
